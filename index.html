<h1>Hi there, I'm Ciarán.</h1>

<br>

<p>I build robots and I have red hair. The name sounded funnier before I bought the URL. </p>

<br>

<p>Here's my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1maZHGKpf7-BFIfLRjmXRZJ7sm2WGZMk3cmj3QiuYp4I/edit?usp=sharing">resume</a>. Find me on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/ciarannmurphy">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ciaranmurphy">Facebook</a>.</p>

<br>

<h3>Here's some stuff I've worked on:</h3>

<h4>Patents:</h4>

<p>I have two (pending) patents in 3D printing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.patentsencyclopedia.com/app/20160101571">SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING ORTHOTIC DEVICE MODELS BY SURFACE MAPPING AND EXTRUSION</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.patentsencyclopedia.com/app/20160101572">SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING A PATTERNED ORTHOTIC DEVICE</a></p>

<br>

<h4>Meural Digital Canvas (Now a NETGEAR Company!)</h4>

<p>I'm currently handling hardware concept, design, and production at <a href="www.meural.com">Meural</a>. This device is kind of like an Amazon Kindle, except it's for curated art and sits on your wall.</p>

<p>The new devices, <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0743/9193/products/tilted-vertical-walnut_1024x1024.jpg?v=1507597297">Winslow</a>, <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0743/9193/products/tilted-vertical-black_1024x1024.jpg?v=1507597100">Leonora Black</a>, and <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0743/9193/products/tilted-vertical-white_1024x1024.jpg?v=1507597202">Leonora White</a> are lighter, easier to manufacture, and are <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0743/9193/products/corner-black_1024x1024.jpg?v=1507597102">more</a> <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0743/9193/products/corner-walnut_1024x1024.jpg?v=1507597299"> distinctive</a> compared to the previous versions. </p>

<h4>Single Color Barcode:</h4>

<p>Barcodes usually have two colors. Using only one color is a little more difficult, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxpk1UHLfPr-aXF1WjR5Y2Q3SUJrN3lvYzQzNTZKVkF3eGww/view?usp=sharing">but I did it anyway</a>.</p>

<br>

<h4>Pick to Light System</h4>

<p>Rather than looking at a list of parts and their corresponding tools, why not scan a part and <a href="https://goo.gl/tPkreN">light up the appropriate tool</a>?</p>

<br>

<h4>Restroom Occupancy Signal:</h4>

<p>It's really difficult for quickly growing startups to scale their restrooms. When those rooms are really far away, it's even more annoying. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1R4DQWWOE8TZzE2Z2VpQlluNEU/view?usp=sharing">So I fixed the problem<a>. Saved the company tons of money and won their hackathon.</p>

<br>

<h4>Custom Industrial Robot:</h4>

<p>At an older company, normal industrial robots were far too expensive. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1R4DQWWOE8TWlpjOUlEYk45aFU/view?usp=sharing">I made this Teflon spraying robot instead</a>. <a href="vimeo.com/72571287">Here's a video of it in action</a>. As far as I know, they're still using it.</p>

<br>

<h4>Nozzles and machining:</h4>

<p>Before that, I helped a company try to disrupt the air conditioner industry by using the Bernoulli effect. Here are <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1R4DQWWOE8TSktXbEpodm9VV28/view?usp=sharing">some of</a> the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1R4DQWWOE8TTmVWVFdudmdHUGc/view?usp=sharing">fancy nozzles</a> I designed and built.</p>

<br>

<h4>Redesigning Chinese Factories:</h4>

<p>When I was still in school, I moved to China and <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-082410-195111/">redesigned equipment in Caterpillar's manufacturing lines</a>. Won some awards for that.</p>

<br>

<h4>NASA Robots:</h4>

<p>Before that, I was on a team that built <a href="http://robotics.nasa.gov/lmr/lmrp_prototype6.php">rovers for NASA</a>. NASA wanted to send a bunch of really cheap robots to the moon. Turns out you can reduce your costs substantially if you use interns. These machines are probably going to stay on Earth, but it was pretty cool at the time.</p>

<br>

<h4>FIRST:</h4>

<p><a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~first/2012/index.html?">My old FIRST Robotics team</a> won a championship back in 2007.</p>
